# EMU8086-Drawer
emu8086-drawer_v0.9.20161218 [Obviously pre-released in 18 dec. of 2016]

After around 4 days serious coding..., ultimately it's done.
EMU8086-drawer application is an application for converting simple graphical draws and shapes to 8086 assembly code in graphic mode.

Story of what happens I decided code this?!
Once opon a day, at usual Microprocceing lab.  I thought with myy self why we should repeat assembly codes for drawing every point, line and etc. when those codes has alot of repeating lines and we just change their numbers? 
so I started this application, Now what you're seeing is a pre-released[build 9.20161218] as first version of what I thought tha moments.

Acknowledgment
Best regards & a lot of thanks to Dr. Masoud Ziabari for supporting. He encouraged me to complete and develope the project to the commercial version and publish it; but unfortunately I haven't enough time to do it, also I programmed this application just for rescue myself from wasting time in lab..

Suggestion for future development
Next version should has
	-installable components for new commands
	-more interacive suggestion box for completing automatically the orders.
